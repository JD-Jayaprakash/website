    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-layout">
      <br/><br/>
      I am Jeyadev (JD) Jayaprakash, a freshman at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering. 
      <br/><br/>With a BME degree, I plan to work at the intersection of electrical engineering and neuroscience, developing technologies that can interpret, amplify, and translate neural signals into meaningful statistical outputs. I’m especially driven by the idea of creating interfaces that allow the brain to communicate naturally with external tools whether that means restoring lost movement, enhancing cognitive control, or enabling entirely new modes of interaction. In the long term, I hope to build systems that make computing more intuitive and human-centered. From next-generation prosthetics that respond as seamlessly as biological limbs, to vehicles and wearable devices that adapt dynamically to a person’s intent, I want to design technologies that feel less like machines and more like extensions of the body. Through research and engineering, my goal is to make these neural-integrated systems more accessible, reliable, and capable of improving daily life for people on every level.

      <h4>“Lastly, one should never discount the importance of “blind, dumb luck,” as we have been blessed with good fortune at almost every turn.”</h4> 
      <h5>Michael Rosbash - Nobel Prize Banquet Speech</h5> 

      <br/>My interest in biomedical engineering began with an iFixit Toolkit from my aunt. I was obsessed, using it on every device I could find, tearing apart its workings to analyze and reverse engineer. Therefore, my interest was furthered in Anatomy and Physiology, which revealed how the body’s intricate systems paralleled how electrical signaling links technology and biology. Consequently, the complexity of neural networks, constantly adapting yet electrically traceable, captivated me. Thereby, BME enticed me, blending biological complexity with problem-solving, allowing me to explore how living systems operate at both mechanical and molecular levels.
      <br/><br/>Moreover, during a dual-enrollment summer, I interned at the Vazquez Research Group at NCSU, where I helped develop bio-integrated implantable devices to improve patient health informatics. Specifically, on my first day, tables filled with prototypes measuring heart rate, blood oxygen, and electrolyte levels immediately drew me in. I spent weeks analyzing these devices and collecting data, which immersed me into the real-world impacts of engineering on human health. Moreover, I floated between every possible project, from photoelectrics to blood electrolyte analyzing to nanoscale simulations. 
      <br/><br/>Now, I continue to be fascinated by the convergence of radioactivity, chemical engineering, and materials science in medical device innovation in my nanoscience elective this semester. 
      <br/><br/>At UNC, I plan on pursuing a lab in the BME umbrella to refine my research experience in the field.

    <br/><br/><h3>Research Statement</h3><br/>
    <p>Modulating neural activity in motor and premotor cortices enables external devices to be controlled directly from intention-related signals. Building on early demonstrations from brain-computer interfaces, such as intracortical arrays used to decode motor intent and drive robotic limbs, precise recordings from collections of neurons can restore volitional movement in individuals with paralysis. As implantable prosthetics move toward greater sensory and motor integration, bidirectional interfaces capable of both decoding outgoing signals and delivering targeted sensory feedback represent the next step toward naturalistic control. I intend to research how increasing electrode density, improving signal stability, and refining stimulation protocols can enhance the responsiveness and embodiment of neural-controlled implantable prosthetics.
